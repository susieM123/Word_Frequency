# Word Frequency Analysis
### Susie Mueller

## Objectives

In this project, you will analyze word frequencies in large text datasets using efficient MapSet data structures implemented with binary search trees (BST) and hash maps. You will leverage the provided WordCounter class to build and manage word-count mappings, explore the performance differences between data structures, and compare language usage patterns across two distinct corpora: Reddit comments and the complete works of William Shakespeare.

## Goals

- Use the WordCounter class to build a MapSet of word counts from large text files.
- Analyze and compare the top 10 most frequent words in Reddit comments versus Shakespeare’s works.
- Measure and compare the time taken to build word maps using BST and HashMap data structures.
- Investigate structural properties such as the maximum depth of BSTs after insertion to understand performance characteristics.
- Interpret how data structure properties impact build times and overall analysis efficiency.

## Tools & Libraries

- Java – primary programming language
- ArrayList – for storing and processing lists of words
- System.currentTimeMillis() – for performance timing
- Basic file I/O – for reading text files and writing word count output files
